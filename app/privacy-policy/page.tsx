              <h3 className="text-xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 (1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 (1) lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information in your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally carried out on the basis of § 25 (1) TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for contract fulfillment or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following sections of this privacy policy.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This sometimes requires the transmission of personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data from our customers on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The lawfulness of data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-semibold uppercase text-sm">
                If data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right at any time to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your affected personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims (objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR).
              </p>

                If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct marketing purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR).

                In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format.

                <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from being stored – only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

In all other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in effectively handling inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be revoked at any time.
